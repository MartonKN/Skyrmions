The difference between ver6 and ver7 is that the latter saves the expectation values of 
the annihilation operators <Phi_1>, <Phi_2> and <Phi_3>. So now one may use the auxiliary
MATLAB program that plots a detailed picture of the TOF peaks

/home/marton/Asztal/PhD/Skyrmionok/3_ThreeComponents/3_PlotTOF

Furthermore, I've deleted those parts of the program from ver7 that were supposed to calculate
the excitation spectrum of the skyrmion, but we never used them. One can put these features back
to the program, by copying here all the files that begin with 'SPECT_' from the folder 'ver6'.
